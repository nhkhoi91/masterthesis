\section{A statement of the problem}
Recommender system has been an interesting subject of research for long. The idea of recommender system began in early 1990s - with the popularization of the internet, to utilize the critique of millions of people online to help us acquire more useful and interesting content. The PARC Tapestry system \cite{goldberg1992using} first introduced the novel idea of collaborative filtering technique in 1992, which instantaneously became a subject of interest for many other research groups and was employed in many systems, including the GroupLens system \cite{resnick1994open}, the Ringo system at MIT \cite{shardanand1995social}, and the Bellcore Video Recommender \cite{hill1995recommending}.
